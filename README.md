# Malware Detection
Malware Detection is a significant part of endpoint security including workstations, servers, cloud instances, and mobile devices. Malware Detection is used to detect and identify malicious activities caused by malware.
An analysis is conducted by our team to classify a piece of software as malicious or legitimate based on the features of the software like size of code, size of header etc.
This is a supervised learning conducted on the dataset which has been collected previously and will be used for the classification study.
